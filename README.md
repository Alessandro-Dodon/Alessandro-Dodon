# Welcome

I am Alessandro Dodon, an MS student in Quantitative Finance at USI Lugano, holding a BS in Economics, Politics, and Social Sciences from Unibo Bologna. My academic interests include applied mathematics, machine learning applications in economics and finance, simulation techniques, time series forecasting, and Bayesian statistics.

I regularly update this GitHub page with my work and continuously add new material. Each repository contains all relevant code, data, and reports/explanations to provide a complete understanding of the projects.

## Projects

- 'InflationForecast': A comprehensive project on forecasting inflation using econometric and machine learning models, such as AR, Lasso, Ridge, Principal Component Regression (PCR), Random Forest, and Vector Autoregression (VAR).

- 'Progresa': Policy analysis of the Progresa program, employing techniques like univariate and multivariate regression, logistic regression, Difference-in-Differences (DiD), and Instrumental Variables (IV).

- 'FinancialCrisis09': An analytical project on the 2009 financial crisis, featuring descriptive statistics, web scraping, interactive visualizations, and machine learning methods, including cluster analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

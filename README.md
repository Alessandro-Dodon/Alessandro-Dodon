# Welcome!

I am a Master's student in Quantitative Finance at USI Lugano, with a Bachelor's degree in Economics and a minor in Data Analysis from the University of Bologna.

My academic and research interests include:
- Data science and machine learning
- Financial econometrics
- Asset pricing
- Risk management

This GitHub page is a curated collection of my academic work and personal projects. I regularly update it with code, documentation, and new material across economics and finance topics.

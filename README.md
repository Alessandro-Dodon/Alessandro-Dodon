# Welcome!

I am a MS student in Quantitative Finance at USI Lugano, holding a BS in Economics with a minor in Data Analysis from Unibo Bologna. My academic interests include applied mathematics, machine learning applications in economics and finance and time series econometrics.

I regularly update this GitHub page with my work and add new material. You can find all relevant code, data, and detailed explanations in the respective repositories listed below.

## Projects

- `InflationForecast`: A series of econometric and machine learning models for inflation prediction (I'm improving and updating the code right now).
- `FinancialCrisis09`: Analysis of the 2009 financial crisis using extensive descriptive statistics and machine learning methods like PCA and cluster analysis.
- `Progresa`: Evaluation of the Progresa program using econometric tools like IV regression and DiD.
- `Garch`: Custom implementation of GARCH models from scratch, applying MC simulations and computing VaR and ES (coming soon).

## Contacts

# Welcome!

I am a MS student in Quantitative Finance at USI Lugano, holding a BS in Economics, Politics, and Social Sciences with a minor in Data Analysis from Unibo Bologna. My academic interests include applied mathematics, econometrics, machine learning applications in economics and finance, simulation techniques and time series forecasting.

I regularly update this GitHub page with my work and add new material. You can find all relevant code, data, and detailed explanations in the respective repositories listed below.

## Projects

- `InflationForecast`: A series of econometric and machine learning models for inflation prediction.
- `FinancialCrisis09`: Analysis of the 2009 financial crisis using descriptive statistics and machine learning.
- `Progresa`: Evaluation of the Progresa program using econometric tools like IV regression and DiD.
- `Garch`: Custom implementation of GARCH models from scratch, applying MC simulations and computing VaR and ES (coming soon).
